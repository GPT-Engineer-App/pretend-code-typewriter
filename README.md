# pretend-code-typewriter

I want you to help me create a website where users can "pretend" to type code. I'll give you a code snippet of some open-source python code but i want you to print a single command/variableword with every users keystroke on their keyboard regardless of the keystroke. So, whatever they type, you just output the next word/command from the code.

This is the code to be used for fun:


import subprocess
import time

from pathlib import Path
from typing import Optional, Tuple, Union

from gpt_engineer.core.base_execution_env import BaseExecutionEnv
from gpt_engineer.core.default.file_store import FileStore
from gpt_engineer.core.files_dict import FilesDict


class DiskExecutionEnv(BaseExecutionEnv):
    """
    An execution environment that runs code on the local file system and captures
    the output of the execution.

    This class is responsible for executing code that is stored on disk. It ensures that
    the necessary entrypoint file exists and then runs the code using a subprocess. If the
    execution is interrupted by the user, it handles the interruption gracefully.

    Attributes
    ----------
    store : FileStore
        An instance of FileStore that manages the storage of files in the execution
        environment.
    """

    def __init__(self, path: Union[str, Path, None] = None):

        return self

                stderr = p.stderr.readline()
                if stdout:
                    print(stdout, end="")
